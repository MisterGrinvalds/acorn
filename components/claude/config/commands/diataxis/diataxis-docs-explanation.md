# Diataxis: Create Explanation Documentation

Create or improve **Explanation** documentation for this project using Diataxis principles.

## Explanation Characteristics (Understanding-Oriented, Theoretical)

**Purpose**: Deepen comprehension through discussion and context

**Core Principles**:
1. **Make connections**: Link concepts and ideas together
2. **Provide context**: History, design decisions, constraints
3. **Talk about the subject**: Discuss bigger picture and alternatives
4. **Explore why**: Not just how, but why things are done this way
5. **Admit perspective**: Acknowledge opinions and multiple viewpoints
6. **Stay bounded**: Avoid instruction or technical reference
7. **Enable reflection**: Best consumed away from active work

**Structure Requirements**:
- Discursive treatment of topics
- Higher, wider perspective
- Distance from immediate practice
- Weaves together fragmented knowledge
- Discussion-oriented, not prescriptive

**Content Types**:
- Architecture decisions and rationale
- Design philosophy
- Concept explanations
- Historical context
- Trade-offs and alternatives
- Best practice rationale
- Domain knowledge

**Language Conventions**:
- Exploratory, discussion-oriented
- "Can you tell me about...?" questions answered
- Multiple perspectives acknowledged
- Context and background provided
- Connections between concepts highlighted

**Examples for This Project**:
- "Why We Chose Cobra Over Other CLI Frameworks"
- "Understanding Command Hierarchy Design"
- "The 12-Factor Approach in This Project"
- "Architecture Decisions and Trade-offs"
- "CLI Design Philosophy"

Create explanation documentation that helps users understand the "why" behind your project, deepening their mastery and preventing anxiety about incomplete knowledge.
