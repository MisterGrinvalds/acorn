# Diataxis: Create Tutorial Documentation

Create or improve **Tutorial** documentation for this project using Diataxis principles.

## Tutorial Characteristics (Learning-Oriented, Practical)

**Purpose**: Guide learners through acquiring skills via hands-on experience

**Core Principles**:
1. **Don't teach through explanation**—create experiences enabling learning
2. **Show destinations upfront** so learners understand their goal
3. **Deliver visible results frequently** to reinforce understanding
4. **Maintain narrative expectations** with detailed output examples
5. **Direct attention** to what learners should observe
6. **Foster the feeling of doing**—the rhythm and pleasure of skilled work
7. **Enable repetition** for confidence-building
8. **Minimize explanation** ruthlessly; link to reference instead
9. **Focus on concrete steps** rather than abstractions
10. **Achieve reliability**—tutorials must work perfectly every time

**Structure Requirements**:
- Meaningful activities toward achievable goals
- Guaranteed success for learners
- Logical progression
- Frequent visible results
- Teacher has full responsibility

**Language Conventions**:
- Use "we" (affirming tutor-learner relationship)
- Clear imperative instructions
- Minimal justifications
- Explicit output expectations
- Recognize learner accomplishments

**Examples for This Project**:
- "Getting Started with [Project Name]"
- "Your First CLI Command"
- "Building a Complete Feature from Scratch"

Create tutorial documentation that enables learning through guided, successful experiences.
