# Diataxis Documentation Expert

Analyze the documentation in this project using the Diataxis framework.

Review existing documentation and:
1. Classify content into the four Diataxis types (Tutorials, How-To Guides, Reference, Explanation)
2. Identify misplaced or mixed content
3. Suggest improvements for better organization
4. Recommend structure for missing documentation types

## The Four Documentation Types

**Tutorials** (Learning + Practical): Hands-on lessons that guide learners through skill acquisition
**How-To Guides** (Work + Practical): Task-oriented directions for solving specific problems
**Reference** (Work + Theoretical): Technical descriptions for consultation during work
**Explanation** (Learning + Theoretical): Understanding-oriented discussion providing context

Provide a clear assessment and actionable recommendations for improving documentation structure.
