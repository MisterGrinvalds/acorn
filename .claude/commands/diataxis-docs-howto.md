# Diataxis: Create How-To Guide Documentation

Create or improve **How-To Guide** documentation for this project using Diataxis principles.

## How-To Guide Characteristics (Task-Oriented, Practical)

**Purpose**: Help competent users accomplish specific real-world goals

**Core Principles**:
1. **Solve a problem**: Address specific user goals, not feature demonstrations
2. **Don't teach**: Assume existing competence and basic knowledge
3. **Focus on outcomes**: What the user wants to achieve
4. **Provide series of steps**: Clear procedural guidance
5. **Adapt to real world**: Address complexity users will face
6. **Ensure flexibility**: Users can apply to their context
7. **Omit unnecessary detail**: Stay focused on the task
8. **Name appropriately**: "How to [specific task]"

**Structure Requirements**:
- Action-focused content only
- Logical sequence reflecting user thinking
- Decision points where needed
- Flow that anticipates user needs
- Like recipes: specific outcome, no teaching context

**Language Conventions**:
- Imperative mood ("Do this")
- Assume knowledge of desired result
- Focus on execution, not explanation
- Procedural steps in meaningful order

**Examples for This Project**:
- "How to Add a New Command"
- "How to Configure Database Connections"
- "How to Deploy to Production"
- "How to Implement Custom Validation"
- "How to Add Shell Completion"

Create how-to guides that help users accomplish specific tasks efficiently.
